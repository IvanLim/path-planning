# Path Planning Project
   
### Simulator.
This project requires the Udacity Simulator that can be found at [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
To safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The simulator provides the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car will try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible. This is also done with minimal jerk, and without colliding with any other vehicles.

### Path Generation Model
A simple state machine is used to manage the driving state. There are two possible states:
* **stay_in_lane**: If no vehicle in front, try to reach and maintain maximum allowed speed. If there is a vehicle and lane changing is impossible, follow the vehicle's speed.
* **changing_lane**: If the vehicle in front is too slow and we are too close to it and there are lanes that we can safely change into, choose the lane with the most available space ahead.

During each cycle, the sensor fusion data is processed to determine if we should accelerate/decelerate/stay in the current lane, or change lanes. Once the **target lane** and the **reference velocity** have been worked out, the path is then generated by creating 3 widely spaced points, and then fitting a spline through it to interpolate the remaining points in between. This keeps the path smooth and jerk free.

### Results and Observations
Vehicle is able to stay close to the speed limit, complete the track safely, change lanes when it is safe, and follow vehicles if lane changing is not possible. In the last test it kept going until the simulator was stopped 15 minutes later.

However, there are rare cases where collisions have been observed:
* When the vehicle in another lane suddenly changes lane right in front of the vehicle
* When the vehicle directly in front suddenly stops, and the car cannot decelerate quickly enough
In these cases however, the time to react is so short that even a human driver would have trouble avoiding an accident.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.
